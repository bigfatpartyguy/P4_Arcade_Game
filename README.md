## Instructions

This Arcade Game is an implementation of the classic arcade game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger), which was developed by [Konami](https://www.konami.com) in 1981. The object of the game is to direct frogs to their homes one by one by crossing a busy road and navigating a river full of hazards.

To play the game:

    or

* Open index.html in your browser.

The object of the game is to direct your character to the river crossing a road lines one by one and avoiding enemies.

* Select your character.
* Navigate your character using keyboard arrow keys :arrow_left::arrow_up::arrow_right::arrow_down:.
* Avoid enemies one the road. If they touch your character you have to start over.
* Once your character reach the the river you won and character's position would reset.
